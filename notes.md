# Notes

(these are mostly notes for myself, so this file can get messy)

Leanpub looks in the `manuscript` directory for the `Book.txt` and `Sample.txt`.
These files contain the names of the files that should be bundled to create the
book.

This book should be a good introduction to relative beginners. E.g. we should
explain some Python stuff like decorators. Yet it should also be interesting
for more advanced Flexx users.

Include reference docs?

Asides?

Get a domain name for a landing page to link to github, docs, book, etc.

All topics in the book should in principle be documented in the reference docs.
