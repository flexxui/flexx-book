# flexx-book - the comprehensive guide to Flexx

This is the source code for the Flexx book, which is published as an ebook on 
[Leanpub](http://leanpub.org) (and perhaps as hardcopy via CreateSpace or Lulu).

The book will be available for free at least until Flexx reaches version 1.0.

    * A sample can be read here: https://leanpub.com/flexx/read
    * More links will follow after the first "publication"

(note that at this point a lot is missing ;) ). You can fix typos in the
Github user interface and create a "pull request".
